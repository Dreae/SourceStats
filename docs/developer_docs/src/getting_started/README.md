# Getting Started
Welcome to the SoruceStats developer documentation, and thank you for your interest in
in contributing to the SourceStats project. The aim of this document is to provide
all of the information necessary for setting up your development environment so that you
can start contributing to SourceStats.

### Installing Rust
The first step for developing any part of SourceStats is installing the Rust toolchain.
Head over to [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) and grab the installer for your platform,
follow the instructions for installing the Rust toolchain, and make sure to set your
environment variables so you can access the Rust tools from your shell.
